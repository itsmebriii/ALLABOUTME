         <p class="main">Hi, it’s me — Bri!</p>
        <p class="about-text">
          I’m a passionate learner who loves programming and creating things
          that solve problems. I enjoy building projects, exploring new 
          technologies, and challenging myself with different ideas.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Every day, I make it a goal to gain new knowledge — whether it’s
          coding, design, or even small life lessons. I believe learning never
          stops, and that’s what keeps me motivated.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          when I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me reading, brainstorming
          future projects, or experimenting with ways to improve my skills. I
          dream of growing as a developer, contributing to exciting projects,
          and inspiring others who also want to start their journey in tech.
